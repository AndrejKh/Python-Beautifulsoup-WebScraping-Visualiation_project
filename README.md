# Python-Beautifulsoup-WebScraping-Visualiation_project

## Summary

Various Python 3.7+ utility modules and scripts, mostly geared towards dataviz and used to create the data visualisations in this [flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zarfo/albums) (most of which been posted to reddit at some point by [/u/Udzu](https://www.reddit.com/user/Udzu/)). The modules aren't properly tested but are reasonably simple, generic and docstringed.

## Installation

The stable modules can be installed using `pip` as described in this repository. Experimental (WIP) models can be installed using `pip install pudzu` (for the latest release) or by directly running `pip install .`.
